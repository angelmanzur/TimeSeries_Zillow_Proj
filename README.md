# TimeSeries_Zillow_Proj

# Goal:
Find the 5 hottest zip codes in DC. 

A zipcode is defined as hot, if you make aprofit after buying a house on April 2018, and  selling a year after. 

In this project we will perform a time series analysis on Zillow data containing the sales prices for 2-bedroom units, and try forcast the price on year after the data ends (April 2019)
